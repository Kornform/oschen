✨ Oschen - @chendodev.


## 🛵 **Oschen** 💫

This is a project that I have been working on for several months, perhaps for some it is not important or big, but for me it is a great advance in my life as a programmer and web developer, each commit means my progress and experience, perhaps not with this get the best job in the world, but what I am sure of is that every day I feel more proud of myself, and this, this, has just begun.
